Sure, here's a README file for the project:

# Not Twitter

Not Twitter is a simple social media application that allows users to post short messages, follow other users, and view their feeds. It is built using the MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.

## Getting started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using Git:

```
git clone https://github.com/UlukbekM/not-twitter.git
```

2. Install the dependencies by running the following command in the project directory:

```
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory with the following variables:

```
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/not-twitter
JWT_SECRET=mysecret
```

Replace `not-twitter` with the name of your MongoDB database, and choose a secure value for `JWT_SECRET`.

4. Start the development server by running the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the server on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

The application includes a simple UI built using React. You can use this to create an account, log in, post messages, follow other users, and view your feed.

The server-side code is located in the `server` directory, and the client-side code is located in the `client` directory. You can modify these files to customize the application to your needs.
